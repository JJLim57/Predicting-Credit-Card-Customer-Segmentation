# Predicting-Credit-Card-Customer-Segmentation
A machine learning assignment in which I had to focus on researching and analyzing available related solutions to the problem and recommend an improvement or an entirely new solution.
## Things I learned/revised:
* Data Cleaning
* *
* Data Wrangling
* Data Analysis (EDA)
* Hyperparameter Tuning
* Model Evaluation through evaluation metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 score and AUCROC score.
## Afterthoughts on the project:
Prior to the project, I did a similar projects to this in which I also had to perform preprocessing of data, analyze correlation of attributes and build a machine learning model. Thus, this particular project serves as a revision for me to further 
practice/refine my data science/analytics skills.
